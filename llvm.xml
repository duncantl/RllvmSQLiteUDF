<title>Generating an SQLite UDF Wrapper Routine</title>

<para>
The approach we will take here is to manually generate the wrapper routine
to see what is involved.  We document the steps decisions, shortcuts and shortcomings.
As with the XPath UDFs and generally for creating wrappers, we will start with
an existing module that contains the routine(s) to be wrapped.
For this example, we write the Fibonnaci function implementation as fib()
routine in C and generate the corresponding LLVM IR from that.
We could generate this directly in R, but we do so directly from C code for convenience
so we can focus on the primary issue being discussed.
</para>
<para>
So we load the module with the fib() routine defined
<r:code>
library(Rllvm)
m = parseIR("fib_basic.ll")
</r:code>
</para>

<para>
As we discuss in the draft of the Compiler Technologies in R Book (SQLUDF.xml),
an SQLite3 UDF wrapper routine uses the pointer to the
sqlite3_api_routines structure to access all of the routines it needs to call.
In other words, instead of calling top-level routines,
the routines are stored in fields in a struct which are "function pointers".
These routines for the fibonacci wrapper are int_value() and result_int.
These correspond to calls of the form sqlite3_value_int() and
sqlite3_result_int() in C code, but these are macros that transform to
sqlite_api->value_int() and sqlite3_api->result_int, respectively.

</para>
<para>
We will need access to an sqlite3_api_routines object
and also to the definition of this object.
We need to find the definitions for the function pointers for these
two fields - value_int and result_int.
More generally, we will need access to other routines such as value_double(), result_double()
and marshalling routines for many other types.
</para>
<para>
There are at least two ways for us to go about getting the definition of the sqlite3_api_routines.
One is to interrogate the header files using, e.g., the <omg:pkg>RCIndex</omg:pkg> package.
Another is to extract the type information from another IR module.
We'll use a hybrid of both, relying heavily on the latter and only matching elements by name with the former.
</para>
<para>
The idea to use LLVM IR to get the definition of the sqlite3_api_routines is quite simple.
We write a simple C file that uses one or more of the sqlite3_api_routines fields.
Then we convert that C file to an LLVM IR module.
We then read that into R and use the type from that module in the new module we are creating.
The types are global across the LLVM instance and shared by modules.
</para>
<para>
Our simple C file is
<c:code>
<xi:include href="simpleSQL.c" parse="text"/>    
</c:code>

We create the ll file with
<sh:code>
make simpleSQL.ll
</sh:code>
Note that it is important we compile this with no optimization (i.e. -O0) as otherwise
the type definitions may be optimized out of the resulting IR file.
</para>
<para>
  We  can now read the module containing the ttype definitions from the SQLite3 extension header
  file that we want.
<r:code>
m2 = parseIR("simpleSQL.ll")  # minSQLFib.ll
</r:code>

We want the type definition of the sqlite3_api global variable.
This is a pointer to an sqlite3_api_routines struct. So we get
the global variable, get its type and that pointer's element type:
<r:code>
ty = getElementType(getElementType(getType(m2[["sqlite3_api"]])))
api_routines = ty = as(ty, "StructType")#XXX FIX
</r:code>
This is StrucType object.
It has fields
<r:code>
fields = getFields(ty)
</r:code>
The names of the fields are no longer with the struct as they are not necessary at the IR
level. We can retrieve these names using <omg:pkg>RCIndex</omg:pkg>.  We'll see how to do this later.
For now, we can assume that the value_int field is number 107 and the result_int is number 83 in our
R list.
Therefore, to get the function pointer details for the int_value field, we can use
<r:code>
ff = getElementType(fields[[107]])  # int_value() field.
ff = as(ff, "FunctionType") #XXX FIX
params = getParameters(ff)
</r:code>
We  first call getElementType() as the field is a pointer to a function type. We need the function type.
Then we get the parameters. There is only one. This is a pointer to a sqlite3_value. We will want that type.
So we store it for subsequent use in defining functions that use this type
<r:code>
sql_val = params[[1]]
</r:code>
<r:var>sql_val</r:var> is a Type object, as opposed to a Parameter that has/contains a type.
</para>

<para>
  We use the sqlite3_value   as an opaque data type. We never look inside its definition
  to extract values. We receive them and pass them to other routines.
  So an alternative to extracting the type from our simpleSQL.ll module
  is to define our own opaque data structure for sqlite3_value
<r:code eval="false">
sql_val = structType(list(), "sqlite3_value", getContext(m), withNames = FALSE)
</r:code>  
However,
while this has the same name as the one in simpleSQL.ll, it may not be the identical
type. Accordingly, the sqlite3_value used in function pointers in the sqlite3_api_routines struct
will not necessarily match our types. So it is safer to use the sqlite3_value definition from
simpleSQL.ll for now.
</para>

<para>
Note that if we wanted to check the return type of value_int() is an Int32Type, we could get the type with
<r:code>
rt = getReturnType(ff)
</r:code>
However, we have no need for this.
</para>

<para>
  Our wrapper routine accepts a sqlite3_context pointer, an integer, and an sqlite3_value.
  We need the type for the sqlite3_context.
  We happen to know that the first field in the sqlite3_api_routines is a pointer to a routine that takes
  one argument which is an sqlite3_context. So we extract that type for later use with
<r:code>
tmp = getElementType(fields[[1]])
tmp = as(tmp, "FunctionType") #XXX Fix  
ctxtTy = getParameters(tmp)[[1]]
</r:code>
</para>


<para>
We now have the building blocks for our wrapper routine.
We want to define it with the signature
<c:code>
void sqlfib(sqlite3_context *ctxt, int argc, sqlite3_value **argc)  
</c:code>
We define our corresponding LLVM function as
<r:code>
f = Function("sqlfib", VoidType, list(ctxt = ctxtTy, argc = Int32Type, argv = pointerType(sql_val)), m)
</r:code>
<r:var>ctxtTy</r:var> is the type we extract for the sqlite_context * in the parameter from the first field.
It is a pointer to a sqlite3_context.
Similarly, sql_val is the type corresponding to a pointer to an sqlite3_value.
So we need an additional indirection via <r:expr eval="false">pointerType(sql_val)</r:expr>.
We don't need two calls to pointerType!
</para>

<para>
  Before we  build the body of our wrapper function, we create our module-specific
  instance of our sqlite3_api variable, a pointer to an sqlite3_api_routines object.
  We will be extracting the function pointers we need from this, so we need to create
  it before we use it.
  The type for this is given by <r:expr eval="false">pointerType(api_routines)</r:expr>.
  This is because we peeled away the pointer type when accessing the fields of this struct.
  So we need to create a pointer to this structure now, with
<r:code>
api = createGlobalVariable("sqlite3_api", m, pointerType(api_routines), NULL, linkage = InternalLinkage)
</r:code>
<note>The NULL here for the initializer is vital as otherwise LLVM is confused as to whether this is
a module-local variable or an external variable. This is probably something I should change in Rllvm.</note>
We give it the name sqlite3_api, but there is no need for us to do this.
In LLVM, the names are irrelevant as we are dealing with Value objects now.
</para>
<para>
We will build a very simple wrapper function that does no error handling.
It mirrors the one in minSQL.c.
We have one BasicBlock
<r:code>
b = Block(f)
ir = IRBuilder(b)
</r:code>
We will need access to two of the parameters - ctxt and argv - so we store the parameters in an R variable.
<r:code>
nparams = getParameters(f)
</r:code>
</para>

<para>
Now the LLVM fun starts!
We need to load the value of the sqlite3_api variable in the module so that we can access its
value_int field. So we load this via
<r:code>
api2 = ir$createLoad(api)
</r:code>

Next we access the 106th field. This corresponds to our 107 in R but now we are using 0-based  counting.
As is typical with GEP (get element pointer) instructions, we need to index by 0 first and then the field.
<r:code>
value_int_p = ir$createGEP(api2, c(0L, 106L))
</r:code>
Now we have to load that element to be able to use it.
<r:code>
value_int = ir$createLoad(value_int_p)
</r:code>
We now have a reference to the function pointer that we need to invoke to convert the
first argument to our wrapper to an int value.
</para>
<para>
  So now we need to call that value_int routine.
  We need only pass it the first element of our third parameter argv.
  We could <r:func>createGEP</r:func> to access the first element and load it.
  However, since we are dealing with the first element, we can load it directly by loading argv.
  So we do this as it is simpler:
<r:code>
argv1 = ir$createLoad(nparams[[3]])
</r:code>
<!-- #argv1 = ir$createGEP(nparams[[3]], c(0L)) -->
</para>


<para>
We can now call value_int() to get the value of the first argument passed to the SQL wrapper.
<r:code>
arg = ir$createCall(value_int, argv1)
</r:code>
 <!-- 
This caused issues:  assertion about matching parameter types is failing and terminating.
 problem was argv = pointerType(pointerType()). Only one pointerType. Why???
 Because  the sql_val we extracted from the pregenerated IR gave a
 pointer type to the struct that is sqlite3_value.
 -->
 And we can pass this in our call to our fib1() routine which is the routine that we are wrapping.
 This is a simple call with one argument (<r:var>ans</r:var>) and we have the reference to the
 function in the module as <r:expr eval="false">m$fib1</r:expr>.
 So our instruction to call fib1 is 
<r:code>  
ans = ir$createCall(m$fib1, arg)
</r:code>
and we have our value.
</para>

<para>
  Our final step is to marshal the result of the call to fib1() back to SQL.
  We use return_int for this.
  This needs both an sqlite3_context pointer and the int value.
  However, before we call this routine, we have to extract if as function pointer
  from our sqlite3_api_routines structure.
  We know that this is result_int field is number 82 when using 0-based counting.
  So, like we did for the value_int field, we use a createGEP and load instruction to fetch
  the value of this field in the sqlite3_api pointer object.
<r:code>
result_int = ir$createGEP(api2, c(0L, 82L))
result_int = ir$createLoad(result_int)
</r:code>


<!--
a = getElementType(getType(result_int))
pp = .Call("R_FunctionType_params", a)
getElementType(pp[[1]])

sameType(pp[[2]], getType(ans))

sameType(getType(nparams[[1]]), pp[[1]])
a = getType(nparams[[1]])
b = pp[[1]]
-->
</para>
<para>
  Now that we have this function pointer, we pass it the context object from our first parameter
  and the result from calling fib1(), i.e.,
<r:code>
ir$createCall(result_int, nparams[[1]], ans)
</r:code>
</para>
<para>
  We are all but finished except we need to explicitly return.
  Since the wrapper has a return type of void, we create an empty return:
<r:code>
ir$createReturn()
</r:code>
</para>

<para>
We can now examine our wrapper routine by looking at the entire module  
<r:code eval="false">
showModule(m)
</r:code>
The key content is 
<r:output><![CDATA[

  <title>Setup</title>
<para>
We are almost ready to use this wrapper routine that we programmatically generated
just like we did in the <ulink url="run2.R"/> file.
However, just as we did there, we need to set the value of our sqlite3_api
module-level variable.
We can borrow one from the RSQLiteUDF.so so that is properly initialized.
<r:code>
library("RSQLite")
library("RSQLiteUDF")
db = dbConnect(SQLite(), "foo")
sqliteExtension(db, system.file("libs", "RSQLiteUDF.so", package = "RSQLiteUDF"))
ptr = .Call("R_getSQLite3API", PACKAGE = "RSQLiteUDF")
</r:code>
We can explicitly set the pointer from R or we can create an accessor routine
to set it.
</para>
<para>
Let's consider the accessor. We used that in the run2.R.
The routine is
<c:code>
void
R_setSQLite3API(void *ptr)
{
   sqlite3_api = (sqlite3_api_routines *) ptr;
}
</c:code>
</para>
<para>
We can generate this routine in the module with the following LLVM instructions:
<r:code>
  f2 = Function("R_setSQLite3API", VoidType, list(pointerType(VoidType)), m)
  b = Block(f2)
  ir = IRBuilder(b)
  val = getParameters(f2)[[1]]
  ir$createStore( val, ir$createBitCast( api, pointerType(getType(val))))
  ir$createReturn()
</r:code>
Note the need to cast the value.
</para>

<para>
Again, as in run2.R, we can call this and set the value of sqlite3_api in our module with
<r:code eval="false">
ee = ExecutionEngine(m)
cif = Rffi::CIF(Rffi::voidType, list(Rffi::pointerType))  
.llvm(m$R_setSQLite3API, ptr, .ee = ee, .ffi = cif)  
</r:code>
</para>
<para>
  We have now established the module so that we can use it within an SQL request.
  We use something very similar to run2.R, only changing the name of our routine to sqlfib,
  to register the routine with SQL as a UDF.
<r:code>
ptr = getPointerToFunction(m$sqlfib, ee)
createSQLFunction(db, ptr@ref, "fib", nargs = 1L)
</r:code>
Now we can use it in a query.
<r:code>
d = dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT x, fib(x) FROM mytable")
d2 = dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT x FROM mytable WHERE fib(x) >= 8")
</r:code>
